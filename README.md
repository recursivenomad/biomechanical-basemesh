**(WIP) A biomechanically topologized and rigged generic human basemesh**
=========================================================================

### Providing universal topology for physically accurate deformations in existing realtime game engine workflows.

&nbsp;



***Purpose and scope***
=======================

The primary purpose of this project is to create a feature-rich human 3D model which can be adapted to any relatively-realistic human form (regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, etc).
By adapting the shape of the model without altering its topology, all features like physically accurate rigging, edge flow, and deformations are preserved (and transferrable).
In addition to physical accuracy, universality, and scalability, it's also a priority for this model to by fully compatible with existing realtime rendering and game engine standards.

*The first region of interest to be developed in this project will be the human face. Stay tuned...*
